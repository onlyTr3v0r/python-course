# Getting Started

This aims to provide setup instructions and conventions for the course.

## Notes

We use "Bobirty Quandale" as our default variable name. Long story :P

Extra information is given in references, like ^[\<n\>]^

The output of programs is follows `>>` in code snippets, ex.

```python
print("Bobirty")
>> Bobirty
```
