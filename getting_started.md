# Getting Started

This aims to provide setup instructions and conventions for the course.

## Notes

We use "Bobirty Quandale" as our default variable name. Long story :P

The output of programs is follows `>>` in code snippets, ex.

```python
print("Bobirty")
>> Bobirty
```

Advanced or extra information is denoted by `[<topic name>]` in text. At the bottom of each page should be a Notes header, which contains the extra information.
